what is file compression

File compression in Linux means reducing the size of a file using algorithms to save space or transfer faster.

why do we need to compress a file?
- when transferring files of large size from one server to another
- when keeping backups of old files
- or simply saving storage space on your server

ls -lh -> to see the size of the folder and files in human readable format

gzip file.txt (1.1G file reduced to 1.1M file.txt.gz) compress

gunzip file.txt.gz ( 1.1M file changed to 1.1G file.txt) decompress

while compressing you want the original file as well, so redirect the compressed zip to the another file
gzip -c file.txt > file.txt.gz ( original file and the compressed file will be present)


Multiple files to be compressed

gzip command only works on the files not folder, in this case we can do the file archiving

what is file Archiving
File archiving means collecting multiple files(and directories) into a single file for easier storage, backup, or transfer - without necessarily reducing their size.

# creating a tar archive
tar -cvf archive_name.tar file1.txt file2.txt

1)we are creating it into tar
tar -cvf backup.tar backup/ 
ls -lh --> a backup.tar file is created

#compressing the tar archive with gzip
tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz file1.txt file2.txt

here we are compressing
gzip backup.tar
ls -lh --> backup.tar.gz 

#Decompressing a tar.gz archive 
tar -xzvf archive_name.tar.gz

rm -rf backup
ls -lh --> backup folder will be deleted

tar -xvf backup.tar.gz

ls -lh --> the backup folder will be available
ls backup --> all the file inside the folder is present

#Compressing multiple files
zip archive_name.zip file1.txt file2.txt

zip files.zip file1 file2
ls -lh --> zipped file will be available

#Decompressing a zip archive 
unzip archive_name.zip

unzip files.zip

Zip is the easiest and the straightforward command in all the cases, so why dont we always use zip command and why gzip or tar?

Zip command is not always comes pre-default or pre-installed on all the Linux environment

when to use tar,gzip VS zip?

gzip - best for compressing a single large file.
tar+gzip - best when you need to compress an entire folder
zip - Best when you need compatibility with windows or macOS as .zip is widely supported
