CASE 1
How to ignore the upper and lower case while searching - grep -i "keyword" file 
- grep Candy users.csv - in candy if we use smaller it will not print anything because it is case sensitive.
- grep -i candy users.csv - -i is ignore case sensitive.

CASE 2

- grep -v john file1 - will give other than john 

CASE 3
To print how many times (count) given keyword present in file 
- grep -c "keyword" file 

CASE 4 
To search for a exact match of given keyword in a file 
- grep Cand users.csv ( it will give all the possible of the keyword )
- grep -w "keyword" file ( when using -w it will give the exact match. when you dont want the related word but want the exact match)

CASE 5
To print the line no. of matches of given keyword in a file
- grep -n "keyword" file ( will give the line number of the keyword)

CASE 6
To search a given keyword in multiple files
- grep "keyword" file1 file2...
Note: By default result of multiple files shows file name in front of the result 

CASE 7 
To suppress file names while search a given keyword in multiple files 
- grep -h "keyword" file1 file2... ( if dont want the file name )

CASE 8

CASE 9

CASE 10
To get the keywords/pattern from a file and match with a another file 
- grep -f keyword.txt file ( grep -f file1 (pattern) file2 (in which you want to search for) )
- grep -f file1 users.csv (shows matched pattern)

CASE 11
To print the matching line which start with given keyword
- grep "^keyword" file 

CASE 12

- grep -R "keyword" dirA/

CASE 14
if you just wanna search but dont want to print on terminal
